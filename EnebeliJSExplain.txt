Loops - 5 types (while, for, 'find out the rest')
while (number < 10) {
    alert('number is less than 10')
}
for (let i=0; i++; i<3) {
    alert('i love you')
}

Conditional statements
if (gender = female) {
    alert('you are a lady')
}
else if (gender = male) {
    alert('you are a guy')
}
else {
    alert('i dont know you')
}

Functions - allows you use a particular code repeatedly
function showMessage() {
    alert('Hi there')
}
after declaring our function as above, u can call it anywhere
and multiple times in the file/project as thus
showMessage()
this will then show the message "Hi there"

Objects - to group are particular number of vars
objects can be structured like this
let user = {}
user['name'] = 'Ethan';
user['age'] = 30;
or like this
let user = {
    name: 'Ethan',
    age: 30
}
Console - helps to display snippets of code or actions on the
browser console. Can be used for debugging. e.g
console.log('hi there')
will display the message 'hi there' on the console
